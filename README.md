## Contributing

Even though this is a non-functional project, as you can see, it works as part of my personal portfolio. All the properties and functionalities are available, even the payment field that redirects the page to stripe(which is working in test mode).

If you want to try a test mode payment try with the test card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242, you can select a random expiring date and a cvc code.
s
You can also test the database of this project, which has been built on Sanity, you will be able to update the existing product information or even upload a new one. In order to do this, you can go to the following link https://ecommerce-sound-tech-store.sanity.studio and check the schemas are already set.
 
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
